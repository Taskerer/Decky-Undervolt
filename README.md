Decky-Undervolt is a Decky Loader plugin that allows you to undervolt your Steam Deck without any pain using [ryzenadj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj).

## Future Plans

- [ ] Preset management
- [ ] Dynamic undervolt adjustment based on CPU load


## Compatibility

Tested only on SteamOS, probably will work anywhere else if installed on Steam Deck except for Windows.
